# Getting Started 
``` bash
TypeScript is JavaScript with syntax for Types
```
# Why
# 1. Type Safety
``` bash 
TypeScript introduces static typing, allowing developers to define types for variables, function parameters, and return values.
```
# 2. Code Quality 
``` bash
With type annotations, code becomes more self-documenting and easier to understand.
```

# 3. Early Error Detection: 
``` bash
The TypeScript compiler can catch common mistakes and type mismatches during development.
```
