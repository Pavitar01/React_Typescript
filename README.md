# Getting Started
``` bash
TypeScript is JavaScript with syntax for Types
```
# Why
# 1. Type Safety:
TypeScript introduces static typing, allowing developers to define types for variables, function parameters, and return values.
2.Code Quality: With type annotations, code becomes more self-documenting and easier to understand.
3.Early Error Detection: The TypeScript compiler can catch common mistakes and type mismatches during development.
4.Modern JavaScript Features: TypeScript supports the latest ECMAScript features while providing compatibility with older browsers.
5.Maintained by Microsoft: TypeScript is developed and maintained by Microsoft, which means it has a solid backing and is likely to continue receiving updates and improvements.
```
# What are key Features of TypeScript
``` bash
1. Static Typing: TypeScript allows you to specify types for variables, function parameters, and return values. This helps catch type-related errors at compile time rather than runtime. Types also provide better code documentation and understanding.
2. Compile Time Checks: TypeScript code is transpiled into JavaScript before execution. During this process, the TypeScript compiler performs static type checking and other validations, helping to catch errors and issues before the code is run.
