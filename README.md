# Getting Started React With TyepSCript
``` bash
TypeScript is JavaScript with syntax for Types
```
# Why
# 1. Type Safety
``` bash 
TypeScript introduces static typing, allowing developers to define types for variables, function parameters, and return values.
```
# 2. Code Quality 
``` bash
With type annotations, code becomes more self-documenting and easier to understand.
```

# 3. Early Error Detection: 
``` bash
The TypeScript compiler can catch common mistakes and type mismatches during development.
```
# What are key Features of TypeScript
``` bash
1. Static Typing: TypeScript allows you to specify types for variables, function parameters, and return values. This helps catch type-related errors at compile time rather than runtime. Types also provide better code documentation and understanding.
2. Compile Time Checks: TypeScript code is transpiled into JavaScript before execution. During this process, the TypeScript compiler performs static type checking and other validations, helping to catch errors and issues before the code is run.
